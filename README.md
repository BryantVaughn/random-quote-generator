# Random Quote Generator

This is the first project in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree on Treehouse. It uses an array of quote objects and displays them randomly on the page, one at a time. It's built to show a new quote every 10 seconds through the use of the `setInterval` function. I also added an array of hex colors which are used to randomly select a background color every time the quote is updated.
